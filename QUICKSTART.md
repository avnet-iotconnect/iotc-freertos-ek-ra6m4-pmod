# Quickstart

The binary image is located at `e2studio/` (`.hex` extension).

To flash the image, please download the [Renesas Flash Programmer](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/software-tool/renesas-flash-programmer-programming-gui#downloads).

At the time of writing, the latest version is **3.15**.

# Flashing

## Linux

Unpack the `RFP_CLI` archive downloaded from the link above (e.g. `RFP_CLI_Linux_V31500_x64.tgz`).

The resulting folder should have the necessary `rfp-cli` program.

Connect your board using the USB cable.

To flash the image, use the `rfp-cli` tool with the `-device RA -tool jlink -if swd -a` parameters. 

Here is an example:

```
~/work/iotconnect/test $ linux-x64/rfp-cli -device RA -tool jlink -if swd -a ./e2studio/quickstart_ek_ra6m4_ep.hex

# Usage 

Once the device is flashed, the device will boot and start sending out telemetry.

Assuming your DA16x00 device is connected to the correct PMOD port and is configured to connect to your IoTConnect instance correctly, the telemetry will be visible in your IoTConnect dashboard.

Commands may be sent to the device as supported (refer to the [README](./README.md)).
