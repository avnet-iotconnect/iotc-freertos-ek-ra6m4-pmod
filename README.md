## About
Avnet IoTConnect AT Command Interface project example for the Renesas CK-RA6M5 v2.

This code is based on the [CK-RA6M4 Sample Code]() project and uses an [IoTConnect AT Command-enabled PMOD module (e.g. DA16K based)](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-dialog-da16k-sdk) as a gateway.
